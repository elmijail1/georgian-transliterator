# Georgian Transliterator

## ℹ️ Description

This web app helps you turn Latin script into Georgian. That is, characters like ABC to აბც.

## 🤷‍♂️ Why do I need it?

First things first: this app is certainly not for everyone. There's a high chance that you'll find it useful, if you:

- Live in Georgia 🇬🇪
- Don't speak much Georgian
- Receive lots of promotional mobile messages
- Use lots of Georgia-based apps

If you don't tick even a single box, you still might find this app interesting if you:

- Care about languages (especially not very widespread ones)
- Like language-related apps and tools

If you live in Georgia but don't speak much Georgian, understanding texts in that language might be an issue. It has its own alphabet that differs a lot from the Latin one. Online translators help, of course, but they have limitations. This app helps you deal with one of them.

Sometimes you can find a text in Georgian written in Latin characters. It's quite common for mobile messages, for example. Pasting a text like that to most translators won't work as they don't treat the Latin text you pass to them as Georgian. That means that you first need to turn the Latin text into the special Georgian script.

I spent quite some time doing it manually. And it took too much time to just put up with it. So I decided to create an app that can do it for you. You pass a text written in Latin to it and it returns the same text in the Georgian script. Now you can safely pass it to the online translator of your choice to get a translation!

## 📖 Usage

Using Georgian Transliterator is straightforward:

1. Copy a text in the Latin script
2. Paste it into the input window
3. Get the same text in the Georgian script in the output window
4. Copy it with the help of the button on the bottom right

However, if you're willing to spend some time learning about how it works, you'll discover more cool features that will help you with _transliterating_ things. By the way, transliteration just means changing the text from one script to another. So despite being a formidable word, it describes a simple concept and is quite handy in this context, so I'll use it more often from now on.
